# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning about pointers, arrays and strings.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. 98 Battery st.<br/>_**0-reset_to_98.c**_ contains a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
+ [x] 1\. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream<br/>_**1-swap.c**_ contains a function that swaps the values of two integers.
+ [x] 2\. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read<br/>_**2-strlen.c**_ contains a function that returns the length of a string.
+ [x] 3\. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them<br/>_**3-puts.c**_ contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
+ [x] 4\. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear<br/>_**4-print_rev.c**_ a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 5\. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes<br/>_**5-rev_string.c**_ contains a function that reverses a string.
+ [x] 6\. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true<br/>_**6-puts2.c**_ contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 7\. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half<br/>_**7-puts_half.c**_ contains a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 8\. Arrays are not pointers<br/>_**8-print_array.c**_ contains a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 9\. strcpy<br/>_**9-strcpy.c**_ contains a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
+ [x] 10\. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers<br/>_**100-atoi.c**_ contains a function that converts a string to an integer.
+ [x] 11\. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code<br/>_**101-keygen.c**_ generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c).
