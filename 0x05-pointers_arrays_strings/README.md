# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

-   What are pointers and how to use them
-   What are arrays and how to use them
-   What are the differences between pointers and arrays
-   How to use strings and how to manipulate them
-   Scope of variables

### [11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic](./100-prime_factor.c)

-   Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

### [12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper](./101-print_number.c)
