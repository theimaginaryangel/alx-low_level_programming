# 0x03. C - Debugging

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

-   What is debugging
-   What are some methods of debugging manually
-   How to read the error messages

### [0. Multiple mains](./0-main.c)

-   Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

### [1. Like, comment, subscribe](./1-main.c)

-   Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

### [2. 0 > 972?](./2-largest_number.c)

-   Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

### [3. Leap year](./3-print_remaining_days.c)

-   Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
