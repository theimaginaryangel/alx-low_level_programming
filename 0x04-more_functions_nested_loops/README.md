# More Functions And Nested Loops

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning more functions and nested loops.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. isupper<br/>_**0-isupper.c**_ checks for uppercase character.
+ [x] 1\. isdigit<br/>_**1-isdigit.c**_ checks for a base 10 digit.
+ [x] 2\. Collaboration is multiplication<br/>_**2-mul.c**_ multiplies two integers.
+ [x] 3\. The numbers speak for themselves<br/>_**3-print_numbers.c**_ prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`.
+ [x] 4\. I believe in numbers and signs<br/>_**4-print_most_numbers.c**_ prints the numbers, from `0` to `9` except `2` and `4`.
+ [x] 5\. Numbers constitute the only universal language<br/>_**5-more_numbers.c**_ prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`.
+ [x] 6\. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line<br/>_**6-print_line.c**_ draws a straight line in the terminal.
+ [x] 7\. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe<br/>_**7-print_diagonal.c**_ draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
+ [x] 8\. You are so much sunshine in every square inch<br/>_**8-print_square.c**_ prints a square.
+ [x] 9\. Fizz-Buzz<br/>_**9-fizz_buzz.c**_ prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
+ [x] 10\. Triangles<br/>_**10-print_triangle.c**_ prints a triangle.
+ [x] 11\. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic<br/>_**100-prime_factor.c**_ prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`.
+ [x] 12\. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper<br/>_**101-print_number.c**_ prints an integer.
