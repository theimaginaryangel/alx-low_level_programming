# Hello World

This project contains introductory __C__ related tasks.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. Preprocessor<br/>_**0-preprocessor**_ runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output would be saved in the file `c`.
+ [x] 1\. Compiler<br/>_**1-compiler**_ compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.
+ [x] 2\. Assembler<br/>_**2-assembler**_ generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
+ [x] 3\. Name<br/>_**3-name**_ compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.
+ [x] 4\. Hello, puts<br/>_**4-puts.c**_ prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `puts` rather than `printf`.
+ [x] 5\. Hello, printf<br/>_**5-printf.c**_ prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line using the function `printf` rather than the function `puts`. The program should compile without warning when using the `-Wall` `gcc` option.
+ [x] 6\. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation<br/>_**6-size.c**_ prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. You might have to install the package `libc6-dev-i386` on your Linux system to test the `-m32` `gcc` option.
+ [x] 7\. Intel<br/>_**100-intel**_ generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
+ [x] 8\. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity<br/>_**101-quote.c**_ prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.The functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) `printf` or man (3) `puts` would not be used. The return value of the program would be 1 and would compile without any warnings when using the `-Wall` `gcc` option.
